## Yangwei You ([Curriculum Vitae](yangweiyou.github.io/cv/yangwei_cv.pdf))
During my Master and Ph.D. period, I focused on the controlling of dynamical legged robots. The main concern of this is to stabilize the walking or running of legged robots under the real-time requirement of online motion planning. Another key point is to utilize whole body dynamics to regulate the interaction between the feet and ground. My research on this involves optimization-based torque control and online planning. I believe these are also essential characteristics for robots to get out of laboratories, factories and come to our everyday life. I wish I can keep on staying in this area and witness the coming of smart robots.
